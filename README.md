# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This project and webpage is a requirement for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp pre-course self study. I did this so I would be better prepared going into the bootcamp, at the suggestion of the orientation material and my Student Success Manager.

Building the website deepened my basic understanding of HTML and helped me learn the very basics of CSS and JavaScript, as well as interfacing with GitHub and several key developer tools including GitBash and VS Code.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website lists basic notes on four different subjects covered: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It also has a JavaScript function embedded to randomly suggest an area of study, viewable though browser developer tools in the Console tab. You can use the DevTools tool in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, and after navigating to the Console tab the JavaScript in the page will randomize one of the four subjects as a suggestion to study.
